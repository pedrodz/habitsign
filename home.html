<h3>Create your dynamic, habit-centered email signatures in less than 5 minutes (for coach.me members).</h3> 
<p>After experimenting with habits for years, I noticed that accountability is key to change a habit, but is always lacking.<br> 
Friends and family are too busy in their lives for such a commitment, and virtual accountability is not the same as people you know IRL.<br>
Adding your progress at changing habits in the email signature, make email receivers potential accountants<br>
This is a tool I made for myself. I am not related with Coach.me. Feel free to use, at your own risk. Feedback is welcome.</p>
